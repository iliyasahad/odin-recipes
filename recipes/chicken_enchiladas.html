    <h2>These creamy Mississippi chicken enchiladas take creamy, cheesy slow cooker Mississippi chicken, 
        flavored with pepperoncini and ranch dressing, to a new level. 
        Shredding the chicken and making baked enchiladas is the obvious next step.

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken, ranch dressing mix, pepperoncini, pepper juice, butter, and water, in that order, into a slow cooker. 
            Cook on High for 2 hours or Low for 3 1/2 hours until chicken easily shreds with a fork.        
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (1 degrees C). Remove half of the liquid in the slow cooker and discard. 
            Shred chicken in the remaining liquid. Stir in cream cheese and sour cream. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place about 1/2 cup chicken mixture and 2 tablespoons cheese in each tortilla and roll to seal. 
            Place seam side down in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese and pour heavy cream evenly over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. 
            Top with green onions and pico de gallo.
